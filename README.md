Daily issues I encounter and overcome while building
The image upload, resize and water-mark folder, is a simple
script that uploads, resizes and watermarks a picture in php

The doc folder, extracts data from a .txt file and saves the data to a database

Feel free to raise an issue, if you come across any bugs or difficulties
